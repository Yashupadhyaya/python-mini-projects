================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code does not validate the input values for the products, which could lead to incorrect calculations or potentially dangerous operations if the input is not numerical.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the values provided for the product quantities are numerical and within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency (CWE-829)
Issue: The code imports modules without specifying version numbers, which could lead to the inadvertent use of outdated or vulnerable versions of these modules.
Solution: Specify exact versions of third-party modules in the project's requirements file to ensure the use of secure and up-to-date dependencies.

Vulnerability: Code Injection (CWE-94)
Issue: The use of string concatenation to set prices in `self.medical_price.set`, `self.medical_tax.set`, etc., could potentially be exploited if unsanitized input is used, leading to code injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized methods or proper sanitization to handle external input and construct strings securely.

Vulnerability: Floating Point Representation (CWE-681)
Issue: The code uses floating-point arithmetic for currency calculations, which can lead to precision issues and incorrect billing due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in computers.
Solution: Use the `decimal.Decimal` class from Python's `decimal` module for accurate decimal arithmetic when dealing with currency.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Proper calculation of medical items total
Details:
  TestName: test_medical_items_total_calculation

Validation:
  This test ensures that medical tax is calculated correctly according to the specified business rules, which affects the final billing amount.

Scenario 5: Proper calculation of grocery tax
Details:
  TestName: test_grocery_tax_calculation
  Description: Ensure the grocery tax is calculated correctly as 5% of the total grocery price, rounded to two decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the Bill_App object with grocery items and their quantities.

Scenario 6: Proper calculation of cold drinks tax
Details:
  TestName: test_cold_drinks_tax_calculation
  Description: Confirm that the cold drinks tax is calculated as 10% of the total cold drinks price, rounded to two decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the Bill_App object with cold drinks items and their quantities.
  Act: Call the total method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Ensure that the cold_drinks_tax attribute is 10% of the total_cold_drinks_price, rounded to two decimal places.
Validation:
  This test checks the accuracy of the cold drinks tax calculation, which is crucial for the final amount charged to the customer.

Scenario 7: Calculation of the total bill
Details:
  TestName: test_total_bill_calculation
  Description: Verify that the total bill is the sum of the total prices of all categories (medical, grocery, cold drinks) plus their respective taxes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the Bill_App object with all items and their quantities, including medical, grocery, and cold drinks.
  Act: Call the total method on the Bill_App object.
  Assert: Check if the total_bill attribute is the sum of all total prices and taxes of the individual categories.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the final bill is calculated correctly, summing the total prices and taxes, which is essential for providing the customer with an accurate total amount due.
