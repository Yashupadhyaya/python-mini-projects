================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure File Access or CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
Issue: The method find_bill concatenates user input directly into the file path, allowing for directory traversal attacks.
Solution: Sanitize user input by validating or encoding it to ensure it does not contain directory traversal characters or sequences. Use os.path.join for safely constructing file paths.

Vulnerability: Resource Leak or CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
Issue: The file opened in the find_bill method is not always closed properly, which can lead to a file descriptor leak.
Solution: Use the 'with' statement to open files, ensuring that they are always closed properly, even if an error occurs.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency Management
Issue: The code imports modules without specifying version numbers, potentially leading to the use of outdated or vulnerable libraries.
Solution: Pin dependencies to specific versions to avoid automatic upgrades to potentially incompatible or vulnerable versions.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation or CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The program does not validate the bill number input before using it to access files, which may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement strict input validation checks to ensure the bill number conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The application inserts content directly into the GUI (tkinter Text widget) which may be susceptible to script injection if the text area interprets input as code.
Solution: Ensure any dynamic content displayed in the GUI is properly escaped or treated as plain text, not as executable code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Bill exists and is found successfully
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_success
  Description: Verify that find_bill successfully finds an existing bill by its bill number and populates the text area with its contents.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock directory structure with 'bills/' containing a file named with the expected bill number. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute containing the bill number.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the text area is populated with the contents of the bill file and that no error message is shown.
Validation:
  This test validates the core functionality of the find_bill method, ensuring that when a bill is present in the directory and matches the search criteria, its contents are correctly displayed to the user.

Scenario 2: Bill does not exist and error is shown
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_failure
  Description: Ensure that when the bill number is not found in the 'bills/' directory, an error message is displayed to the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock directory structure with 'bills/' containing files, none of which match the expected bill number. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute containing the non-existing bill number.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the error message box is shown with the appropriate "Invalid Bill No" message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly handles the absence of a bill by informing the user, which is crucial for user experience and error handling.

Scenario 3: Bill directory does not exist
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_no_directory
  Description: Verify that the application handles the situation where the 'bills/' directory does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the 'bills/' directory does not exist. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error handling is triggered, such as showing an error message box or handling the missing directory exception.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's robustness in handling unexpected environmental issues, such as missing directories, which might occur due to misconfiguration or file system constraints.

Scenario 4: Multiple bills with the same number
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_multiple_matches
  Description: Confirm that find_bill behaves correctly when there are multiple bills with the same number in the directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock directory structure with 'bills/' containing multiple files with the same bill number. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute containing the duplicated bill number.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that only one instance of the bill content is displayed in the text area and that the method does not append or merge content from multiple files.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method handles duplicate bills correctly by only considering the first match and prevents data corruption by not combining contents from different files.

Scenario 5: Empty bill file
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_empty_file
  Description: Verify that find_bill correctly handles the case where the bill file is found but is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock directory structure with 'bills/' containing an empty file with the expected bill number. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute containing the bill number.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the text area remains empty and that no error message is shown.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the method can handle edge cases where a bill exists but contains no data, without misleading the user into thinking a non-existent bill was searched for.

Scenario 6: File read permissions issue
Details:
  TestName: test_find_bill_read_permission_error
  Description: Ensure that find_bill handles the case where the bill file exists but cannot be read due to permission issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock directory structure with 'bills/' containing a file with the expected bill number but with read permissions removed. Initialize the Bill_App object with a mock search_bill attribute containing the bill number.
  Act: Invoke the find_bill method.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error handling is triggered, such as showing an error message box or logging the permission error.
Validation:
  This test checks how the method handles file access errors, which are critical for maintaining the application's stability and providing feedback to the user about issues outside of their control.
