Scenario 1: Testing with a valid image
Details:
  TestName: test_img_to_ascii_valid_image
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function works correctly with a valid image input. The image is resized and thresholded successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Load a valid image into a numpy array.
  Act: Call the img_to_ascii function with the image as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned numpy array is resized correctly and thresholded.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the basic functionality of the function. If the function can't handle valid image input, it's not working as intended.

Scenario 2: Testing with an empty image
Details:
  TestName: test_img_to_ascii_empty_image
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when given an empty image. The function should return an empty numpy array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty numpy array to represent an empty image.
  Act: Call the img_to_ascii function with the empty image as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned numpy array is also empty.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle edge cases properly. An empty image could be a possible input and the function should be able to handle it without crashing.

Scenario 3: Testing with a large image
Details:
  TestName: test_img_to_ascii_large_image
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle very large images. The function should be able to resize and threshold the image without any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Load a very large image into a numpy array.
  Act: Call the img_to_ascii function with the large image as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned numpy array is resized correctly and thresholded.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's performance and ability to handle large inputs. If the function can't handle large images, it may not be suitable for some use cases.

Scenario 4: Testing with a non-image numpy array
Details:
  TestName: test_img_to_ascii_non_image_array
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when given a non-image numpy array. The function should return an error or handle the input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-image numpy array.
  Act: Call the img_to_ascii function with the non-image array as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function handles this input gracefully, either by returning an error or a specific output.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks if the function can handle invalid inputs properly. Even though the function is expected to receive images, it should be able to handle other types of input gracefully.
