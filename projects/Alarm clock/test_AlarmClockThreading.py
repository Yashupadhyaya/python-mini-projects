Scenario 1: Validate Threading Function
Details:
  TestName: test_threading_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the Threading function successfully starts a new thread running the alarm function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Threading function. No parameters are needed.
  Assert: Check that a new thread has been started. This can be done by checking the number of active threads before and after invoking the Threading function. The number of active threads should increase by one after the function is invoked.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the Threading function is operating as expected, i.e., it is starting a new thread running the specified function. This is a critical aspect of the function's specifications and business requirements: the function is meant to start a new thread, and this test confirms that it does.

Scenario 2: Validate Alarm Function
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the alarm function, which is called by the Threading function, is working as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the winsound and time modules to simulate their behavior and avoid actually playing a sound or waiting for a specific time.
  Act: Invoke the Threading function. No parameters are needed.
  Assert: Check that the alarm function was invoked by checking the mock objects for the winsound and time modules. They should indicate that the appropriate methods were called.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the alarm function, which is the function that the Threading function is supposed to run in a new thread, is working as expected. This is a critical aspect of the function's specifications and business requirements: the Threading function is meant to start a new thread running the alarm function, and this test confirms that the alarm function is performing its duties correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate Thread Termination
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_termination
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the thread started by the Threading function terminates correctly after the alarm function has completed its execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the winsound and time modules to simulate their behavior and avoid actually playing a sound or waiting for a specific time.
  Act: Invoke the Threading function. No parameters are needed.
  Assert: Check that the number of active threads decreases by one after a certain amount of time (which should be equal to or greater than the time it takes for the alarm function to complete its execution).
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the thread started by the Threading function terminates correctly. This is a critical aspect of the function's specifications and business requirements: the Threading function is meant to start a new thread, run the alarm function in that thread, and then the thread should terminate correctly. This test confirms that this is the case.
