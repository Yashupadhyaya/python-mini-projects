Scenario 1: Test if the Thread is Created and Started Successfully
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_creation_and_start
  Description: This test is intended to verify if a new thread is created and started successfully when the Threading function is called. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread object to intercept its creation and start.
  Act: Call the Threading function.
  Assert: Check if the Thread object was created with the target function 'alarm' and if the Thread's start method was called.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is crucial as the function's main purpose is to create and start a new thread. The expected result is directly connected to the function's specification.

Scenario 2: Test if the Function Handles Thread Errors Properly
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_error_handling
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can handle any errors that occur during the creation or starting of the thread.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread object to raise an error when its start method is called.
  Act: Call the Threading function.
  Assert: Check if the function can handle the error appropriately, such as by logging the error or raising an exception.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important to ensure that any errors that occur during the thread's creation or start are properly handled and do not cause the program to crash unexpectedly. 

Scenario 3: Test if the Thread Executes the Target Function
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_execution_of_target_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the thread executes the target function 'alarm' when it is started.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the 'alarm' function to track its execution.
  Act: Call the Threading function.
  Assert: Check if the 'alarm' function was executed.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important because the thread's purpose is to execute the 'alarm' function. The expected result is directly related to the function's specification and the program's overall functionality. 

Scenario 4: Test the Threading Function with Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_calls_of_threading_function
  Description: This test is intended to verify if multiple threads can be created and started successfully when the Threading function is called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Thread object to intercept its creation and start.
  Act: Call the Threading function multiple times.
  Assert: Check if a new Thread object was created and started for each call to the Threading function.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle multiple calls correctly, creating and starting a new thread for each call.
