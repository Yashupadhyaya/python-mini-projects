ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=alarm_6edf31f1cc


Scenario 1: Testing the alarm triggering at the correct time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_trigger
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the alarm function triggers the alarm at the correct time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the datetime and winsound modules. Set a specific time for the alarm to go off.
  Act: Call the alarm function and fast forward the time to the alarm time.
  Assert: Check if the winsound.PlaySound function was called.
Validation:
  The alarm function's primary responsibility is to trigger an alarm at the set time. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that it does so accurately.

Scenario 2: Testing the alarm not triggering before the set time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_no_trigger_before_time
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the alarm does not trigger before the set time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the datetime and winsound modules. Set a specific time for the alarm to go off.
  Act: Call the alarm function and fast forward the time to just before the alarm time.
  Assert: Check that the winsound.PlaySound function was not called.
Validation:
  The alarm function should not trigger the alarm before the set time. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 3: Testing the alarm triggering multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_trigger_multiple_times
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the alarm triggers again if the time reaches the set time again.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the datetime and winsound modules. Set a specific time for the alarm to go off.
  Act: Call the alarm function and fast forward the time to the alarm time twice.
  Assert: Check that the winsound.PlaySound function was called twice.
Validation:
  The alarm function should trigger the alarm every time the current time matches the set time. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 4: Testing the alarm with different times
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_different_times
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the alarm function works correctly with different set times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the datetime and winsound modules. Set different times for the alarm to go off.
  Act: Call the alarm function with different set times and fast forward the time to each set time.
  Assert: Check that the winsound.PlaySound function was called at the correct times.
Validation:
  The alarm function should be able to handle different alarm times. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when different times are set.
